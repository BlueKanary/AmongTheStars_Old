# AmongTheStars

Among the Stars is a Sci-fi game about walking through large spaceships.


### Design Document

The focus of AtS is on NPC interaction. 

Not many roguelikes have a big focus on NPC interaction. Those that do usually have scripted or simple NPCs.
My goal is to never have an "enemy" NPC, who cannot be interacted with beyond fight or flee. These NPCs also walk around interacting with other things such as repairing, guarding, eating, and other various tasks that sustain themselves and cause reactions.
